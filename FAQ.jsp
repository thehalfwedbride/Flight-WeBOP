          	<li><b>How can I opt for wheelchair assistance at the airport?</b><br>
			<ul>
				<br><li><b>Wheelchair Assistance</b>
				<br>We have wheelchairs available for use at all airport locations to assist with transportation from check-in to the boarding gate, making connections (if applicable) and from the aircraft to the arrivals hall at the destination. However, this depends upon the availability of wheelchairs on flight.</li><br>

				<br><li><b>Carriage of a POC:</b>
				<br>A request for carriage or use of the POC on board needs to be made to WeBOP a minimum forty eight (48) hours in advance from the scheduled departure time.

				<br>During taxi, take-off and landing the POC, if being used must be stowed under the seat in front.</li><br>
				<br><li><b>Seat Allocation:</b>
				<br>Customers carrying/using the POC on board shall be assigned only a window seat, except on rows 1,12 and 13. Such customers shall not be seated on middle or aisle seats. WeBOP reserves rights to change seats of such customers, if required.</li><br>
				<br><li><b>Check-In of POC:</b>
				<br>For safety purposes, Customer must ensure that the POC prior to check in is empty and free of pressure. Thus, if the POC was used before coming to the airport, then the Customer must to reset the POC to avoid any residual oxygen in the equipment
				<br>If POC operates on lithium battery, battery should be removed and carried by Customer as hand baggage.

				<br><li><b>Other conditions:</b>
				<br>In case of the unlikely event of decompression, passengers must wear the oxygen mask from the overhead panel as a primary source of oxygen and not their POC, as the oxygen mask would ensure a continuous flow of oxygen and would also minimize the chance/ effects of decompression sickness.
				<br>POC should not cause any interference with the electrical, navigation or communication equipment on board;
				<br>Passenger carrying the POC on board must comply with all security requirements and instructions communicated by the Crew, from time to time;
